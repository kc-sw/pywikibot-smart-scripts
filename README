== Replace.py ==

These are replace.py "improvements", hoping to make for a strong spellcheck/Proofreading/improvement script that can work a bit smarter and do some more freaky stuff.

* smart_replace.py - Extra options added to the default replace.py. -minchanges:x will skip changes that use fewer than x replacement categories. Useful for preventing minor changes.
* autocorrect_replace.py - Using the autocorrect Python module to suggest corrections. Frequently wrong, can't recommend.
* nlp_correct.py - This uses Python's textblob library to do NLP processing and subsequent correcting. Frequently wrong, can't recommend.
* symspellpy_replace.py - Using the SymSpellpy Python module to suggestion corrections. Frequently wrong, can't recommend.
* bing_spellcheck_replace.py - Using Bing's Spellcheck API to do Proofreading of given text. Use -subkey:<subkey> to provide the appropriate subscription key. Rate limiting available. Testing is a WIP.
